React hocs with a common API for storing data outside of React. Query string, local storage etc. ðŸ˜Ž

## Install

```sh
yarn add react-cool-storage ðŸ˜Ž
```

## Hocs

All hocs pass down a `ReactCoolStorageMessage` to their child components:

```js
{
    value: any,
    onChange: (newValue: any) => void,
    available: boolean,
    valid: boolean
}
```

- `value` - The current value. Defaults to an object with keys and values.
- `onChange` - A callback to change the value. Defaults to requiring an object with keys and values. Values are merged into the exisiting `value`. Setting any key to undefined will remove that key / value pair.
- `available` - Indicates whether the chosen storage mechanism is available to use. When false, `value` defaults to an empty object and `onChange` has no effect.
- `valid` - Indicates whether the value in the chosen storage is able to be parsed correctly. When false, `value` defaults to an empty object.

### ReactRouterQueryStringHoc

`ReactRouterQueryStringHoc` gives you an easy to use binding for working with React Router v4's query string.

It is **controlled**, meaning that it will update immediately whenever the data source (the query string) changes.

```js
ReactRouterQueryStringHoc({
    name: string,
    // optional
    method?: string = "push",
    silent?: boolean = false,
    deconstruct?: Function,
    reconstruct?: Function,
    parse?: (data: string) => any,
    stringify?: (data: any) => string
})
```

- `name` - The name of the prop that will be passed to the hoc's child component.
- `method` - The `history` method to use. Can be "push" or "replace". Defaults to "push".
- `silent` - When false, errors are thrown if there are any missing resources. When true, no errors are thrown and instead `ReactCoolStorageMessage` will contain `available: false` to indicate that the chosen storage mechanism can't be used.
- `deconstruct` - A function that is called before `ReactRouterQueryStringHoc` stringifies data when a change occurs. This provides an opportunity to convert custom data types into simpler ones before stringification takes place. Defaults to a passthrough function.
- `reconstruct` - A function that is called after `ReactRouterQueryStringHoc` has parsed its data. It is given the parsed object. This provides an opportunity to convert data into custom data types before its is received by the hoc's child component. Defaults to a passthrough function.
- `parse` - A function that is called on the value of each key / value pair to turn it from a string into a data shape. Defaults to `JSON.parse()`.
- `stringify` - A function that is called on the value of each key / value pair to turn it from a data shape into a string. Defaults to `JSON.stringify()`.

```js
import ReactRouterQueryStringHoc from 'react-cool-storage/lib/ReactRouterQueryStringHoc';

export default ReactRouterQueryStringHoc({
    name: "query"
})(MyComponent);
```

#### Resources

ReactRouterQueryStringHoc requires three resources:
- `window.URLSearchParams` must exist. Polyfills are available if you need to support older browsers.
- A React Router v4 `history` object as a prop
- A React Router v4 `location` object as a prop

#### Props

ReactRouterQueryStringHoc requires these props to be passed to it:
- A React Router v4 `history` object as a prop
- A React Router v4 `location` object as a prop

#### Child Props

ReactRouterQueryStringHoc passes down a `ReactCoolStorageMessage` as a prop with a name of `name`.

### WebStorageHoc

`WebStorageHoc` gives you an easy to use binding for working with Web Storage i.e. LocalStorage and SessionStorage.
It is **uncontrolled**, meaning that it only reads from storage on initial mount. Changes are saved, but hocs are not updated if the storage changes while mounted.

*TODO: In future, [this will be able to be controlled](https://github.com/blueflag/react-cool-storage/issues/4)*

```js
WebStorageHoc({
    name: string,
    key: string,
    // optional
    method?: string = "localStorage",
    silent?: boolean = false,
    deconstruct?: Function,
    reconstruct?: Function,
    parse?: (data: string) => any,
    stringify?: (data: any) => string
})
```

- `name` - The name of the prop that will be passed to the hoc's child component.
- `key` - A globally unique key that will be used to store the data in web storage.
- `method` - The `history` method to use. Can be "localStorage" or "sessionStorage". Defaults to "localStorage".
- `silent` - When false, errors are thrown if there are any missing resources. When true, no errors are thrown and instead `ReactCoolStorageMessage` will contain `available: false` to indicate that the chosen storage mechanism can't be used.
- `deconstruct` - A function that is called before `WebStorageHoc` stringifies data when a change occurs. This provides an opportunity to convert custom data types into simpler ones before stringification takes place. Defaults to a passthrough function.
- `reconstruct` - A function that is called after `WebStorageHoc` has parsed its data. It is given the parsed object. This provides an opportunity to convert data into custom data types before its is received by the hoc's child component. Defaults to a passthrough function.
- `parse` - A function that is called on the value of each key / value pair to turn it from a string into a data shape. Defaults to `JSON.parse()`.
- `stringify` - A function that is called on the value of each key / value pair to turn it from a data shape into a string. Defaults to `JSON.stringify()`.

```js
import WebStorageHoc from 'react-cool-storage/lib/WebStorageHoc';
export default WebStorageHoc({
    name: "query",
    key: "localStorageKey"
})(MyComponent);
```

#### Resources
WebStorageHoc requires `window.localStorage` or `window.sessionStorage` to be available, depending on the `method` you choose.

This generally means that the browser must support web storage, allow its use, and have sufficient storage space.

#### Props
WebStorageHoc requires no props.

#### Child Props
WebStorageHoc passes down a `ReactCoolStorageMessage` as a prop with a name of `name`.

## The future

- ReactRouterParamHoc

- IronDBHoc?
- LocalForageHoc?
- What else? ðŸ˜Ž
