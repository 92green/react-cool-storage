# WebStorage

<WebStorageExample />

WebStorage gives you an easy to use binding for working with Web Storage i.e. LocalStorage and SessionStorage.

It can only store data that is **serializable** and stored as a string, such as via `JSON.stringify()`.

It is **semi-controlled**, meaning that it will update immediately whenever the data source changes, but only if the changes occur on the current window.
Another window may edit the same data source, and if this happens then hocs on a different window will not automatically update. They will contain the new data as soon as they next re-render.

*TODO: In future, [this will be able to be fully controlled](https://github.com/blueflag/react-cool-storage/issues/4)*

```flow
import WebStorage from 'react-cool-storage/WebStorage';
```

## Config

```flow
WebStorage({
    key: string,
    // optional
    method?: string = "localStorage",
    deconstruct?: (data: any) => any,
    reconstruct?: (data: any) => any,
    parse?: (data: string) => any,
    stringify?: (data: any) => string,
    memoize?: boolean = true,
    initialValue?: any|() => any
})
```

* <Param name="key" type="string" />
  A globally unique key that will be used to store the data in web storage.

* <Param name="method" type="string" default="push" optional />
  The Web Storage method to use. Can be "localStorage" or "sessionStorage". Defaults to "localStorage".

* <Param name="deconstruct" type="(data: any) => any" optional />
  Can be used to convert data into a serializable format. It is called before ReactRouterStorage stringifies data when a change occurs.

* <Param name="reconstruct" type="(data: any) => any" optional />
  Can be used to convert data from a serializable format into richer data types. It is called after ReactRouterStorage has parsed its data. It is given the parsed object.

* <Param name="parse" type="(data: string) => any" optional default="JSON.parse()" />
  A function that is called on the value to turn it from a string into a data shape. Defaults to `JSON.parse()`.

* <Param name="stringify" type="(data: any) => string" optional default="JSON.parse()" />
  A function that is called on the value to turn it from a data shape into a string. Defaults to `JSON.stringify()`.

* <Param name="memoize" type="(data: any) => string" optional default="JSON.parse()" />
  When true, the result of `parse` will be memoized deeply using [deep-memo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-memo) so that references to objects and arrays will remain unchanged unless their values change. This allows parts of the `value` data object to work seamlessly with React pure components. When false, new objects and arrays will be created every time props change, but if a large amount of data is being parsed then disabling memoization can reduce the computation time of the parsing step. Defaults to true.

* <Param name="initialValue" type="any|() => any" optional />
  If provided, `initialValue` will set the value when the storage mechanism is instanciated.

## Resources
WebStorage requires `window.localStorage` or `window.sessionStorage` to be available, depending on the `method` you choose.

This generally means that the browser must support web storage, allow its use, and have sufficient storage space.

## Props
WebStorage requires no props.

## Outside React

WebStorage doesn't require any props, so you can also access and change WebStorage data outside of React. All ReactCoolStorageHocs that use the WebStorage with the same key will update and stay in sync.

`MyWebStorage` has been added to the window on this page. Try running `MyWebStorage.set("foo");` in the console and watch the example update at the top of this page.


## Example using hooks

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactCoolStorageHook from 'react-cool-storage';
import WebStorage from 'react-cool-storage/WebStorage';

const useStorage = ReactCoolStorageHook(
    WebStorage({
        key: 'exampleStorage'
    })
);

export default (props) => {
    let webStorage = useStorage(props);

    return <div>
        <label>Data stored in local storage</label>
        <input
            value={webStorage.value || ""}
            onChange={(event) => webStorage.set(event.currentTarget.value)}
        />
    </div>;
};

// also add a WebStorage instance to the window
// to demonstrate usage outside of React

window.MyWebStorage = WebStorage({
    key: 'exampleStorage'
});
```
