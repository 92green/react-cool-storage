## What is it?

React Cool Storage is a collection of React hooks and higher order components that give you a consistent API for interacting with data stored outside of React.

- All storage mechanisms can contain deeply nested data, and all JSON-compatible types will be retained.
- React Cool Storage allows fallback storage mechanisms to be defined, so your apps can still operate if resources such as `localStorage` are not available.
- All storage mechanisms that don't require props can be accessed and changed outside of React, and all hooks and hocs will update and remain in sync.

### How do you use it?

- Choose your [storage mechanism(s)](#Storage-Mechanisms)
- Put them in a [ReactCoolStorageHook](/api/ReactCoolStorageHook) or a [ReactCoolStorageHoc](/api/ReactCoolStorageHoc)
  - Use the hook in a component and it'll return a [ReactCoolStorageMessage](/api/ReactCoolStorageHook/#ReactCoolStorageMessage), or
  - Wrap your component in the hoc and it'll pass down a [ReactCoolStorageMessage](/api/ReactCoolStorageHoc/#ReactCoolStorageMessage) as a prop
- Get your value using `ReactCoolStorageMessage.value`.
- Set your value using `ReactCoolStorageMessage.onChange(newValue)`. If you pass `newValue` a function, it will call it with the current value and use the result as the new value.
