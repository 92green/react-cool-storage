## What is it?

React Cool Storage is a collection of React hooks and higher order components that give you a consistent API for interacting with data stored outside of React.

- All storage mechanisms can contain deeply nested data, and all JSON-compatible types will be retained.
- React Cool Storage allows fallback storage mechanisms to be defined, so your apps can still operate if resources such as `localStorage` are not available.
- All storage mechanisms that don't require props can be accessed and changed outside of React, and all hooks and hocs will update and remain in sync.

## Getting Started

Do this:

```bash
yarn add react-cool-storage ðŸ˜Ž

Then you can write something like this:
